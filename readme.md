# Metkis Game

## Overview
I made this small (mobile oriented) game as an experiment to test cool game tech like dynamic textures, [ECSY](https://github.com/ecsyjs/ecsy) ECS and physics with [Cannon.js](ttps://schteppe.github.io/cannon.js/).

## Features

- **Mobile oriented**: to play on the go
- **Rendering**: uses `Three.js` for 3D graphics.
- **Physics engine**: `Cannon.js` for realistic physics and emergent gameplay.
- **Game design**: powered by `ECSY` for efficient, organized, and emergent game design.
- **Modelling**: shape-based modeling, combining simple shapes to create complex objects like turrets.
- **Texture and graphics**: includes dynamic texture drawing and a spritesheet made by `Metkis`.
- **User interface**: prototype of a 3D GUI system and on-screen control for mobile devices.
- **Artificial intelligence**: pathfinding based on BFS (Breadth-First Search).
- **Gameplay elements**: introduces waves of enemies, collectable items, and zero-button interactions.
- **Development tools**: built with Rollup for efficient bundling.
